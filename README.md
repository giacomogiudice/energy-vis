# ind.oors
An overview of household consumptions in energy and water.
It was written using the following libraries: **D3.js**, **jQuery**, **RequireJS**.
## Technical
For development purposes use `js/main.js` instead of `js/main.min.js`.

In order to optimise, you must have _node.js_ installed. Then do the following:
- `$ cd js/tools`,
- `$ node r.js -o build.js`,
- `$ cd ../../` to return to the main directory
